Multifrequnecy Antenna Design 
The rapid evolution of information technology and wireless communications
has enabled the development of applications that one was not able to dream of
a few decades ago. Personal communication has become an integral part of our
daily lives. An antenna should radiate efficiently in an intended manner to free
space, while other components should be more or less isolated from their surroundings.
Meanwhile, the reduction in device size has caused an increasingly
higher space constraint in the implementation environments for antenna.
Microstrip antennas have attracted a lot of attention due to rapid growth in
wireless communication area. Several patch designs with single feed, dual frequency
operation have been proposed recently.

1.1 Problem Statement
The aim of this project is to Design, Implement, Fabricate and Test a multiband
Microstrip antenna for 3 operating frequencies-WLAN- 2.4 GHz, GSM-
930 MHz, GSM- 1.84 GHz. The proposed microstrip patch antenna will be
designed using U slot with L probe feeding technique on HFSS and it will be
analyzed using VNA after fabrication. Various parameters will be measured
such as such as VSWR, Gain and Return Loss for different frequencies
